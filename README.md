## 🚀 Overview

This project challenges traditional coverage-guided fuzzing, which is often inefficient for complex targets like the V8 JavaScript engine. Such fuzzers waste effort on low-risk inputs and can accidentally destroy vulnerability-triggering patterns.

Instead of prioritizing new code paths (asking "is this path new?"), we introduce **feature-guided fuzzing**. Our approach asks, **"does this code look dangerous?"**.

To do this, we use:
1.  **LLM-Boosted Feature Engineering:** We use a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze historical V8 vulnerabilities and automatically generate a set of static (code-based) and dynamic (runtime-based) features indicative of high-risk inputs.
2.  **Predictive Guidance Model:** We train an **XGBoost** classifier on these features to predict the likelihood that a new input will trigger a vulnerability.
3.  **Feature-Guided Fuzzer:** We built a fuzzer (on top of Fuzzilli) that uses this model's prediction score as its primary guidance, dedicating 90% of its effort to "exploiting" high-risk seeds and 10% to "exploring" new coverage.

Our results show this model is highly precise (over 85% precision) with a very low false alarm rate (under 1%). We also found that only the **top 25%** of features are needed for this performance, making the fuzzer fast and efficient.

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, run the main dependency installation script:

```bash
./install_deps.sh
```

### 2. Install V8 Engine (via `jsvu`)

For most of the predictive modeling and evaluation, you will need a `d8` shell. The easiest way to get a specific V8 version is by using `jsvu`:

```bash
# Install jsvu globally
sudo npm install -g jsvu

# Install the specific V8 version used for experiments
jsvu v8@14.1.146
```

### 3. Build V8 from Source with Fuzzing Flags

To run the full fuzzer (RQ5) and reproduce the instrumented build, you must compile V8 from source using `depot_tools` with specific build flags (e.g., ASAN, coverage).

```bash
# Define environment variables (adjust paths as needed)
# Assumes v8.tar.gz is in the current directory
export DEPS="$HOME/Downloads/depot_tools"
export V8_COMMIT="YOUR_SPECIFIC_V8_COMMIT_HASH" # e.g., from the paper's experiment
export OUTDIR="out/fuzz"
export NINJA_JOBS=16 # Adjust to your core count

# --- 1. Get Depot Tools ---
if [ ! -d "$DEPS" ]; then
  git clone --depth=1 [https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools) "$DEPS"
else
  echo "depot_tools already exists at $DEPS"
fi

# --- 2. Add to PATH ---
export PATH="$DEPS:$PATH"
if ! grep -Fxq 'export PATH="$HOME/Downloads/depot_tools":$PATH' "$HOME/.bashrc" 2>/dev/null; then
  echo 'export PATH="$HOME/Downloads/depot_tools":$PATH' >> "$HOME/.bashrc"
  echo "Appended depot_tools PATH to ~/.bashrc"
else
  echo "depot_tools PATH already in ~/.bashrc"
fi

# --- 3. Fetch and Build V8 ---
if [ ! -d "v8" ]; then
  tar -zxvf v8.tar.gz || true
else
  echo "v8 directory already exists, skipping fetch"
fi

# Enter V8 directory and build
cd v8 && \
git checkout "$V8_COMMIT" || true && \
gclient sync --with_branch_heads --with_tags || true && \
gn gen "$OUTDIR" --args='is_debug=false is_asan=true dcheck_always_on=true v8_static_library=true v8_enable_verify_heap=true v8_fuzzilli=true sanitizer_coverage_flags="trace-pc-guard" target_cpu="x64"' && \
ninja -j"$NINJA_JOBS" -C "$OUTDDIR" d8
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Set V8 Version in Scripts

Before running the evaluation scripts, you must ensure the dynamic feature extractor points to the correct V8 `d8` binary that you installed.

  * **File to Edit:** `dynamic_feature_extractor_v2.py`
  * **Action:** Open this file and update the variable holding the V8 version/path to match the one you installed (e.g., `v8@14.1.146`).

## 🔬 Reproducing the Paper's Results

The following scripts reproduce the key Research Questions (RQs) from the paper.

### RQ2 & RQ4 (Predictive Performance & Minimal Feature Set)

To evaluate the predictive performance (precision, recall, false alarm) of the guidance model using the time-aware cross-validation setup, run:

```bash
python3.13 prediction_time_aware.py
```

This script also provides the data for analyzing the minimal feature set (RQ4).

### RQ3 (Ablation Study: Static vs. Dynamic Features)

To run the ablation study that compares the performance of the static-only, dynamic-only, and combined feature models, run:

```bash
python3.13 prediction_compare_time_aware.py > compare.txt
```

### RQ5 (Feature-Guided Fuzzing)

Running the full feature-guided fuzzer is a multi-step process. It requires populating the database, launching the prediction services, and then starting the fuzzer.

**1. Populate the Database**

Load the corpus (vulnerable PoCs and benign mjsunit tests) into the database.

```bash
# Load vulnerable PoCs
./load_corpus.sh corpus_pocs loaded_corpus 10 16

# Load benign test cases from mjsunit
./load_corpus.sh corpus_mjsunit loaded_corpus 10 16
```

**2. Run Prediction Services**

These services provide the model's predictions to the fuzzer in real-time. **Run each command in a separate terminal.**

```bash
# Terminal 1: SHAP service for feature importance
python3.13 predict_minimal_shap.py
```

```bash
# Terminal 2: Main crash prediction service
python3.13 crash_predictor_service.py
```

**3. Run the Fuzzer**

With both services running, you can launch the fuzzer:

```bash
./run.sh loaded_corpus
```

The fuzzer will now communicate with the services to score and prioritize seeds based on their predicted risk.
